# R Markdown PDF Challenge
The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we've shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won't feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We're here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.


![http://phdcomics.com/ Comic posted 1-17-2018](c:/Users/Jawairia/Documents/MICB425_portfolio/phd011718s.gif)

## Challenge Goals

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It's a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)

**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com/) to see if you can find the image above**  
*If you can't find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*

### Here's a header!

Let's be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents)

#### Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you're already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you're so confused that you've forgotton how to add. Never fear! ~~A calculator~~ R is here:

``` {r}
1231521+12341556280987
```
### Table Time

Or maybe, after you've added those numbers, you feel like it's about time for a table!  
I'm going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It's not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```

And now you've almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we're so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here's ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

## Origins and Earth Systems

### Evidence worksheet 01 
Paper:
[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
#### What were the main questions being asked?

The main questions were: 

* To determine the number of prokaryotes in different habitats and how much they contribute to the total number of microbes on Earth.
* What are the turnover rates of the microbes in these environments and which habitats are the most productive?
* What is the total amount of cellular carbon and other nutrients (N, P) produced by these prokaryotes on earth?
* Estimate prokaryotic diversity in different habitats.

#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

* Pooling data from studies in which there is sampling of prokaryotes from different habitats, and quantification of cells in these samples and extrapolation, estimations, assumptions, mathematical formulas to calculate cell numbers, nutrient contents etc.:   

* Soil: 
  +estimating prokaryotic abundance in differant habitats  
    + ocean below 200m
        + average cellular density and multiplied it with the estimated amount of marine and fresh water quantities
    + different soils
        + estimations cellular density from direct cell counts from different soils in past field studies.
        + calculate number of microbes by looking at perviously estimated amounts of soil on earth
    + terrestrial subsurface in various dephts
        + estimated prokaryotic numbers from ground water based on values of several sites, and multiplied this using the estimated value of ground water on Earth. 
        - looked at the average porosity of Earth's soil and used known values of space occupied by prokaryotes in these pores
        
    + Animals and other habitats
        + human: skin surface area multiplied by cell density of prokaryotes on the skin  
		    + insects: using termites as a model: multiple number of microbes in insect by total number of insect on the planet.
		    + leaves: leaf area x assumed dense population of microbes  
		    - air: pre-calculated data used
    

#### Summarize the main results or findings.

3 habitats contribute to prokaryotic abundance on Earth.
  + Open ocean: 1.2x 10^29^ cells
  + Soil: 2.6x 10^29^ cells 
  + Subsurfaces: terrestrial and marine: 0.25-2.5x 10^30^ cells

Other important habitas:
  + Animals, leaves, air, groundwater
Further important habitats but with minor contributions to total cell number:  

Total number of prokaryotes on earth: 
  + ~4-6x 10^30^ cells

Total amount of Carbon in prokaryotes: 350-550 Pg which is roughly 60-100% of the total Carbon of plants

Total prokaryotic nutrients (N,P)= 10x nutrient content of plants. (N: 85-130 Pg, P: 9-14 Pg)

Turnover rates for the different habitats:  
  + soil: 2.5 years 
  + Ocean above 200m: 6-25 days  
  + Ocean below 200m: 300 days  
  + Terrestrial subsurface: 1-2x 10^3^ years

cellular productivity: # of cells produced per a unit of time: 
  + Ocean above 200m: highest productivity: 8.2*10^29^ cells/year
  + Total Earth: 1.7x 10^30^ cells/year

The higher the cellular productivity: the more mutation events occur: leads to more diversity. This leads to the emergence of new cycles and pathways.

Authors mention that the number of prokaryotic species may be underestimated due to inadequate sampling methods. 

#### Do new questions arise from the results?

* Subsurface prokaryote turnover rate: very high: is this an over-estimation: need to investigate this habitat further.

* Since the 1980s tools to study microbial diversity have evolved: do they give us better estimates for the above measurements?

* In the lsat 40 years, has the microbial abundance and diversity changed?

* How does the abundance of the prokaryotes in these environments play a role in the total metabolic capcity of these microbes in affecting the global nutrient cycles?

#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

It was hard to understand where some of the numbers, calculations and assumptions came from because it was not very well explained. A discussion on the precision of the data presented in this paper would have been cool.

### Problem set 01

Paper: 
[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)


#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:

#### What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

Open ocean: Total 1.2x 10^29^ cells  

- Top 200m: 3.6x 10^28^  
- Below 200m (+10 cm of marine sediment): 8.2x 10^28^  

Soil: 2.5x 10^29^ cells

Subsurfaces (oceanic + terrestrial): ~3.8x 10^30^ cells

#### What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

Upper 200m of the ocean contains a total 3.6 x 10^28 cells:

->2.9x 10^27^ autotrophs (e.g, cyanobacteria like Prochlorococcus): 8% of total: responsible for carbon assimilation to sustain C requirements of heterotrophic (comprising 92% of total cells) cells. This menans that the carbon in the ocean is cycled within the ocean at higher rates than the carbon from the atmoshpere is fixed. This essentially results in a loss of carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere.

#### What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text? 

* Autotroph: Fix inorganic carbon (CO_2) -> biomass.   
* Heterotroph: use organic carbon to build biomass
* Lithotroph: inorganic substances as electron donor like NH3 

#### Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

4km below the surface (4 km below terrestrial surface or marine sediments) is the deepest that life has been measured. The main limiting factor for life at this depth is temperature:
  * temperature is about 125 deg celcius: limit for prokaryotic life.
  * temperature drops at 22 degrees per km of sruface: Marian's trench, at 10.9 km deep, is the deepest part of the ocean that can support like: another 4 km below the marine sediments of Marian's trench would also contain life.

#### Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?

Spores can survivee at altitudes up to 77km above the surface of the earth. But metabollically active cells can only survive at roughly 20 km above the surface of the earth (so highest would be: Mt. everest: 8.8km + 20 km on top). Limiting factor: cold temperatures, ionizing radiationm lack of nutrients and no pressure.

#### Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth's biosphere measured in km?  

Mariana trench: ~ -10.9 km deep, + - 4 km further below marine sediment
Mt. everest: 8.8km + 20km on top 
vertical distance of Earth's biosphere: 
22 + 8.8 +10.95 +4= 45.7km

#### How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)

Annual cellular production
  * account for population size and growth rate
  * Annual cellular production = Population size (number of cells) x Turnover rate ( in years)
  * Using Subsurface ocean as an example:
      + # cells = 3.6x 10^28^ cells  
      + Turnover time: 16 days
      + Turnover rate = 365 (days/year)/16 ( turnover/days)= 22.81 turnovers per year
      + annual cellular production: 3.6x 10^28^ Cells x 22.81 turnovers per year = 8.2x 10^29^ cells per year
  * Soil:     
	    + # cell = 2.6x 10^29^ cells
	    + turnover time: 900 days
	    + Turnover rate = 0.4 turnovers per year (= 365/900)
	    + annual cellular production:2.6x 10^29^ x 0.4= 10^29^ cells per year

#### What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

  * the net productivity in the ocean is: 51 Pg C/year
  * Total amount of marine C in ocean: 0.7-2.9 Pg
  * calculating the upper limit (2.9 Pg C)
      + Carbon in one cell: 5-20 fg C/cell
      + 20 fg C/cell=20x0^-30^ petagreams C
      + 3.6*10^28^ cells x 20x 10^-30^ pg/cell= 0.72 Pg of C in marine prokaryotes
      + Carbon efficieny while 20% (a factor 5 needed), Authors used 4 in the paper for some reason:
      + 4 x 0.72 Pg = 2.88Pg/year
  * 85% of net productivity in the ocean is consumed in the upper 200 m: 51 Pg C/year X 0.85 = ~43 Pg C/year
      + Turnovers per year in upper 200 m of ocean: 43 pg/yr / 2.88 pg/yr (turnover rate/total amounf of carbon in the ocean)= 14.9 Turnovers per year 
      + So: (14.9 turnovers/year) x (1 year/365 days) = one turnover every 24.5 days. or using the lower limit of C in the ocean: 61 turnovers per eyara ax.


The relationship between carbon assimilation efficiency adn turnover rate with depth varies in different environments  varies because the primary producer fraction of prokaryotes reach different depths in different habitats.

#### How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

  * average mutation rate per DNA replication: 4 x 10^-7^ (mutations/gerneration)
  * for 4 simultaneous mutations: (4 x 10^-7^)^4^ = 2.56 x 10^-26^ mutations per gene per generation   
  *16 turnovers/day: 22.5turnovers/year
  * 3.6 x 10^28^cells (total number of marine cells) x 22.8 turnovers per year = 8.2 x 10^29^ cells produced per year    
  * (8.2 x 10^29^ cells per year) x (2.56 x 10^-26^ mutations per generation) = 2.1 x 10^4^  times per year 4 simulataneous mutations happen
      + 1/[(2.1 x 10^4^ events/ year) * (1 year/365 days) * (1 day /24 hours)]= 2.5 events/hour: or in other words
      + four simoultanous mutations happen every 0.4 hours every 24 minutes. 


#### Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  

Due to high mutation rates and a large population size, the adaptive potential might be much higher than previously thought. The number of prokaryotic species might be much higher than previously estimated. The high diversity implies that prokaryotic cells have the potential to evolve and adapt relatively quick. High mutation rates might allow cells to adapt quickly to changing environments and new metabolic cycles can emerge that might have a great impact on the global nutrient cycle.

Beyond point mutations, microbes can diversify with bigger earrangements in the genome like inversions and deletions. Furthermore, genes can be adopted into the cells from DNA rom neighbouring cells or the environment in a process known as horizontal gene transfer.


#### What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text? 

prokaryotic abundance correlates with magnitude of meetabolic potential.

prokaryotic diversity correlates with diversity of metabolic characteristics.

In conclusion: microbes have a large potential to participate in and alter the earth's biogeochemical cycles.

### Problem set 2: Microbial Engines

[Falkowski et al. 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18497287)

#### What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to mattern and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?  
    + Geophysical: plate tectonics, atmospheric photochemical processes: supply substrates and remove products: interaction of molecules + geochemical cycling.
    + Biogeochemical: Microbially catalyzed redox reactions  drove fluxes of major biolements.
    + Abiotic geochemical reactions are mostly based on acid/base chemistry (transfers of protons/H^+^), while biotic processes are based on redox reactions (successive transfers of electrons and protons). Abiotic reactions can can carry new molecules to biotic reactions supplying these reactions with new electrons for redox.

#### Why is Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?

The Earth's redox state depends on the biogeochemical cycles: feedback between between the evolution of microbial metabolica and geochemical processes is responsible for defining the average redox conditions of the oceans and atmosphere. An emergent property is something that as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The redox state of the planet of the Earth emerges from the combination of many different metabolic processes and reactions catalyzed by different organisms making it an emergent property.

#### How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?

A cycle, to be self-sustaning, must have both forward and reverse reactions. Communities of microbes living together interact with each through the transfer of elextrons via the exchange of metabolites, nutrients and wastes. The thermodynamic properties of a reaction is dependent on reaction conditions and organisms that contain thermodynamic conditions that are facored in these conditions can thrive. Synergistic cooperation between different species in the commpunity allow microbes to work together to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow. Reverse reractions can become possible when substrates become very low in concentrations. For example, the reduction of CO2 to methane using H_2 if the hydrogen pressure is low enough, the reverse reaction becomes thermodynamically favorable. The lowest H_2 concentration would potentially be adjacent to the H_2 utilizing, CO_2 reducing cells. On another scale, the reversible pathways may be catalyzed in a more global manner. 

#### Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox "niches" and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?

Nitrogen fixation allows for the conversion of N~2~ into NH~4~ allowing the element to become accessible for anaerobic and metabolic processes. However, the enzymes responsible for this process is inhibited by O~2~. In the presence of O~2~, NH~4~ is oxidized to nitrate (thrugh nitrite) by a different set of nitrifying organisms. These nitrifiers concurrently perform these reactions to reduce CO~2~ into organic matter. In the absencce of oxygen, microbes may use NO2 and NO3 as electron acceptors in anaerobic oxidation which forms N~2~, thus clsing the nitrogen cycle. This closes the nitrogen cycle. Many different microbial groups are involved in different parts of the nitrogen cycle. 
Nitrifiers also reduce CO~2~ to organic matter. CO~2~ contributes to global warming and climate change. This links the nitrogen cycle to climate change.

#### What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?

Fast turnover rates and large numbers of microbial cells leads to an enormous genetic diversity due to an accumulation of muutations and by acquisition of new genes through orizontal gene transfer. Differenet selective pressures exist in different environments which favor microbes that are capable of utilizing the available substrates. Specialized metabollic pathways arise in these environmetns as a result of the selective pressure and high genetic diversity. Throughout the world, in its myriad collection ofenvironments and selective pressures leads to huge metabolic diversity of microbes. Studies have found that the number of protein families within individual microbial genomes depedns linearly on the number of genes per genome.


#### On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?

Metabolic pathways in microbes have core genes like Rubisco in photoshynthesis. These genes are transferred bth vertically and horizontally to different microbes through strong environmental perturbations into various geological landscapes. Individual taxonomic groups may be sleced against but core metabolic machinery cotinues to survive through these environmental stresses. As a community, different organisms can provide different reactions that make-up a whole metabolic pathway. These different organisms are so well adapted to their environment, and so well distributed in different microbes that these metabolic pathways are unlikely to all go extinct. Even when less specialized microbes go extinct in a certain environment, the core metabolic gene set survives due to the varying envuronments and global distribution of enzymes.

#### Evaluate human impacts on the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems

#### What were the main questions being asked?

Without pressure from humans, the Holocene, the period of geolical stabilty that we are experiencing now, is expected to continue for at least several thousand more years:
What are the planerary boundaries that must not be transgressed in order to prevent the irreversible damage to the earth's systems that keeps the planet in the Holcene?


#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

defining planetary boundaries: safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth's biogeochemical and biophysical systems:
  + quantitaively defined as critical values for one or more control variables greater than which, human life and development become difficult to sustain (e.g. CO~2~ concentrations)
  + control variables that must have thresholds before unacceptable environmental changes soccur:
      + **Climate change**
          + boundary: containing rise in gobal mean temperature to no more than 2 deg C above the pre-inustrial level. based on 2 control variables:
                +  atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations
                + radiation: the rate of energy vchange per unit area of the globe as measured at the top of the atmosphere.
      + **Rate of bidiversity loss**
          + control variable: species loss
      + **interference with the N and P cycles**
          + control variable: rate of N2 removal from atmosphere and rate of N2 fixation.
      + stratospheric ozone depletion
      + ocean acidification
      + global freshwater use
      + Change in land use
      + Chemical pollution
      + Atmospheric aerosol loading
  +normative and conservative, risk averse approach to quantifying planetary boundary: taking into account large uncertainties that surround the true position of the threshold.
 

#### Summarize the main results or findings.

The boundaries of the safe operating space for humans has already been exceeded in three systems all due to human interference:
    + rate of biodiversity loss:
          + spcies are going extinct at a rate not seen since the lsat global mass-extinction event
          + Fossil data: 
          background extinction rate for marine life: 0.1-1 million species per year
          background extinction rate for mammals: 0.2-0.5 extinctions per million species per year.
          + estimated rate of extinction today: 100-1000x more than what would be considered normal (although this is a preliminary data as background extinction rate measurements aren't super confident): 30% mammals will be extinct by 2100 at this rate. Main reason: human activities like:
              + change in land use: urbanization and agriculture in natural ecosystems
              + Introduction of foreign species into new envionemts
              + change in distribution and patterns of wildfire occurance.
          + preserveration biodiversity linked with keeping ecosystems stable and resilient: the more redundnat and complicated a system: the more resilient it is
          + 
        
    + climate change:
          + CO~2~ levels should not exceed 350 ppmv (parts per million by volume) but current levels are at 387 ppmv 
          + radiative forcing should not exceed 1 watt per squre metere above pre-industrial levels but the change in radiative forcing is already 1.5 W/m^2^
          + Most models: a doubling of CO~2~ levles: increase global temperatures by 3 deg Celcius at equilibrium. 
              + but these models don't take into account the long term; postivie feedback loop propertie of global earming: warming leads to melting of icecdaps and changes in vegetation: slow feedbacks can result in an increase of 6 deg Celcius in stead of 3
              + warming interferes with ecological life-supporting systems in the evironemnt: would challenge the viability of contemporary human societies.
          + Some of earth's subsystems are already moving outside their stable Holcene state.
              + e.g. retreat of mounatin glaciers around the world, rise of sea-level in the last 2 decades and loss of global ice sheet mass. 
              
    + human interference with nitrogen cycle
        + causes:
            + Modern agriculture: abuse of N containing fertilizers: Human N fixation using artificial processes is more than the combined effort of **ALL** Earth's terrestrial processes. 
        + Addition of large amounts of usable N: significantly perturbs the global N cycle.Adding N: ends up in the environment and pollutes waterways an accumulating in land systems: adds a number of gasses to the atmosphere.
        + N2O^-^ the most important non Carbon dioxide greenhouse gas: adds to radiative forcing
        + control variable: N~2~ fixation from the atmosphere: should be 25% of what it is now.
        
Small changes in the Earth's biogeochemical and biophysical systems add up and through positive feedback loops: the situtation is exacerbated in the long term.

The different processes listed above are all interconnected in perturbation in one system is often accompanied by perturbations in other systems.

Fast approaching boundaries of three other Earth-system processes:
    + global freshwater use
    + change in land use
    + ocean acidification
    
Some of the data presented in the paper are preliminary results but the evidence so far suggests that remaining below the proposed thresholds for the above processes will allow humans the freedom to continue to pursue long-term social and economic development as they have been since the onset of the Industrial revolution.

#### Do new questions arise from the results?  

What kind of advice do the authors or other experts in the field hve to undo the damage that has already been done?

Are there any boundaries that we are unaware of that is being crossed?

In what ways can the metabolic capacity of microbes be harnessed to reverse some of these changes and to prevent further damage to the Earth's biogeochemial stability?


#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?
No real discussion of methods; it's more like a review.
It was easy to understand and the figures were easy to follow and really helped me understand the massive impact both human activities and microbial metabolism has on determining the Earth's biogeochemical and geological state.

### Module 1 essay


"Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global
catalysis and environmental transformations it provides."  

Ever since the emergence of humans, we have been interacting with microbes. We live in symbiosis with microbes in many different aspects, which rises the important question whether we could survive without them. Microbial life emerged about 4 billion years (1) before the first humans developed, which prooves that microbes can easily live without us. In contrast, confirming that humans cannot survive without the global catalysis provided by microbes, is much more challenging. Several aspects need to be considered in order to answer the question whether humans rely on the presence of microbes. Firstly, after their emergence, the microbes rapidly spread all over the earth and rose to incredible numbers of individuals. Secondly, fast reproduction and constant turnover of the cells leads to massive requirements of nutrients and thereby promotes the global turnover of these nutrients. The fast reproduction of microbes further generates an enormous genetic diversity through mutations, which allows the microbes to constantly adapt present pathways or even generate new metabolic processes. Through this extremely high abundance and diversity, microbes developed a massive potential not only to actively participate in, but also to significantly alter important biogeochemical cycles, which can be shown by several examples covered in this assay. Lastly, this potential for global catalysis leads to important, microbially driven environmental transformations on Earth, creating an atmosphere inhabitable by humans. This not only allowed for the emergence of more complex organisms and the human species, but will also be important for human survival in the future.

Microbes have a massive potential to impact global cycles because of their sheer number of cells present. They account for by far the biggest part of the number of organisms alive on earth and arguably also the greatest part of nutrients stored in living beings. The number of prokaryotes living on earth could be obtained by cell counts of probes sampled from several different habitats. Subsequent projection and extrapolation for habitats not available for sampling led to an estimation of 4-6*1030 cells present (2). Considering average values of nutrient contents per cell, leads to the conclusion that microbes totally contain 60-100% of the amount of carbon stored in plants. The fraction of nitrogen and phosphorus stored in microbes is even higher, with about ten times more of these elements stored in microbes than in plants (2). These numbers show, that through their enormous abundance and capacity, microbes technically have the potential to provide important global catalysis.  
     
In addition to the huge number of microbial cells, their fast turnover rates generate an even higher potential of the microbes to significantly catalyze and transform global cycles. An average turnover rate of 22 turnovers per year leads to about 8.2*1029 heterotrophic cells produced every year, just in the upper 200 meters of the ocean (2). Therefore, the vast amounts of cells continuously being produced further explains their impact on global cycles as their constant metabolism leads to massive requirements and turnover of nutrients. The constant turnover of prokaryotes additionally offers the opportunity to generate an enormous genetic diversity through billions of mutation events (2). The large genetic variation leading to continuous adaptation through evolution enables the bacteria to constantly generate new metabolic pathways and cycles. In summary, the fast microbial reproduction accounts for high nutrient requirement, global circulation of these nutrients and generation of metabolic diversity through evolving cells. This supports the conclusion, that microbes have the potential to significantly transform the environment and even catalyze global cycles in such a powerful way that humans become dependent on their presence on Earth.  
     
The enormous abundance, turnover and diversity provides a huge potential for the microbes to actively contribute to the composition of Earth's properties. These contributions thereby are of such importance that humans would not be able to survive without microbes providing them, which can be shown by several examples. Firstly, marine microorganisms are responsible for the generation of nearly all of the oxygen present in the atmosphere (3). The oxygen produced by plants only contributes to a small fraction of atmospheric oxygen because most of the O2 produced by plants is used up again by their own respiratory processes and upon decay of dead plant material (3). Therefore, the oxygen produced by microbes is substantial for human respiration and hence, also existence. Second, Earth's redox state depends mostly on microbial life and therefore is an emergent property of their existence (4). This means, the global fluxes of some of the most important elements (H, C, N, O, S) are controlled in large parts by redox reactions which are catalyzed by prokaryotes. Thus, microbial photosynthesis not only provides humans with breathable air, but also drives the Earth's oxidation in general, and finally, supplies heterotrophic organisms with reduced carbon. Further, not only photosynthesis, but many other microbial processes contribute to important global nutrient cycles. One example for a cycle largely controlled by microbes is the nitrogen cycle (4). Microbes catalyze all the steps present in the global nitrogen cycle and thereby control the oxidation state in which the nitrogen species are present in Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans. Many other prokaryotes and eukaryotes, that cannot process atmospheric nitrogen, rely on the supply of these nitrogen species provided by nitrogen-fixing microbes. Also humans rely on fixed nitrogen, which initially is provided by microbes and wanders through the food chain until eventually taken up as part of the human nourishment. All of these examples show, that the global nutrient cycles, which are in large parts controlled by microbes, are of such importance, that human existence relies on their catalysis provided by microbes.  
     
The potential of microbes to catalyze global processes does not only affect nutrient cycles, but also the global environment and climate. Microorganisms can significantly change the climate by altering the atmospheric composition (1, 3, 4). The production of several gases like methane and nitrous oxide strongly influences the global climate through the greenhouse effect (1, 3). The great importance of this effect for the survival of organisms can be shown not only for present days, but also for early stages in time. In the distant past, about 3.5 billion of years ago, microbial methane production might have contributed to a global shield, warming up the planet (1). At this time, the sun was much weaker than today and therefore, without a greenhouse gas like methane, Earth would have been completely frozen over. By keeping the earth from freezing, this methane shield might have allowed for fast reproduction, leading to evolution and the emergence of more complex life-forms. About 500 million years later, microbes again significantly transformed the environment. The emergence of photosynthetic cyanobacteria led to a strong increase of the oxygen level in the atmosphere (1). This resulted in decreased viability of methanogenic organisms and therefore decreased methane concentrations, which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect. The consequence was a global glaciation, again significantly changing the composition of organisms capable of living on Earth (1). In summary, in the absence of microbes, the global environment with its properties as present now, could not have been created. In a world depleted of the global catalysis provided by microbes, Earth's environment would have been very unfavorable for the emergence of complex life forms as they are present today. As the past times show, a stable environment, which can be provided and maintained by microbes, will also be necessary for humans to live in future times. If humans wanted to survive without microbes, they would have to artificially control all the cycles currently run by microbes. This, however, is most likely not possible. Humans will not be able to replace all the microbially driven cycles in an efficient way. We are not able to generate machines catalyzing processes as efficient as microbes do after millions of years of evolution. Further, as microbial diversity is unimaginably high, the range of the processes they catalyze can always adapt quickly to changing conditions. Humans will not be able to adapt their engineered machines fast enough in order to provide sufficient flexibility to changing demands.
     
In summary, the enormous number of prokaryotic cells present, their fast turnover and the high genetic diversity offer an unimaginable potential for the microbes to significantly contribute to the presence and properties of biogeochemical cycles. Microbes provide a global environment-composition which allowed for the emergence of humans and will also in the future be necessary for our persistence. From the beginning of our existence, we have been living in symbiosis with microbes. We do not only interact with microbes living in and on our bodies, but also with the global biogeochemical cycles they are a significant part of. Artificially replacing all of the processes provided by microbes will not be possible in a sufficient way. Therefore, existence of human life without the presence of microbes is most likely not possible as our survival strongly depends on stable global cycles, kept intact by microbes. Microbes have been the guardians of global metabolism for billions of years (5). It is very unlikely that humans could further exist without microbes present, continuously guarding global metabolic processes. A new question that arises is however, how likely it is, that the human race eventually manages to destroy this essential function of the microbes as guardians of global metabolism?

#### What is the difference between phylogenetic and functional gene anchors and how can they be used in metagenome analysis?

Phylogenetic anchors are usually genes that are transferred vertically from parent to progeny and are used to generate phylogenetic trees and to assign taxonomy to bacteria. An example are 16s SSu rRNA

Functional gene anchors are genes that are hallmarks of specific metaollic pathways and allow us to gain a better understanding of the metabollic capacity of the members in a microbial community.

[Barker et al. 2005](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010003)

#### What is metagenomic sequence binning? What types of algorithmic approaches are used to produce sequence bins? What are some risks and opportunities associated with using sequence bins for metabolic reconstruction of uncultivated microorganisms?

metagenomic sequencing binning is the process involved in the association of sequening data to genes or taxonomy by building longer sequences from overlapping read.

there are two stategies to this:
composition-based binning and similarity-based binning:
composition based binning doesn't use a reference sequence to assemble metagenomes but instead uses the G/C content on frequency of codon usage to do this.

similarity based binning is dependent on taxonomy: reference sequences are used to assign homologs, like by using BLAST. Bias towards known sequences. this method aloows for phylogenetic classification.

the risks of using sequence bins for metabolic reconstruction are many: compositon based-binning is often eror-prone especially when closely related OTUs are seen.
Often whole genomes are not covered in the metagenomic sequencing so it is hard to completely talk about the metabolic capacity of different OTUs. incomplete coverage of metagenomes also leads to an incrase in inter-species chimera formation. Also, DNA from the species present at lower abundances is not detected as easily. Some sequences cannot be assigned because they do not match what is already known in the databases.

Opportunities: Get a broad overview of the metagenomic potential of a community. it is fast, efficient and based on algorithms that are constantly improving. These methods are definitely more insightful than culture dependent methods.  

#### Is there an alternative to metagenomic shotgun sequencing that can be used to access the metabolic potential of uncultivated microorganisms? What are some risks and opportunities associated with this alternative?
 

Single Cell sequencing:
expensive, and takes a long time. Algorithms associated with this are still being developed. not amplification based so hard to weed out sequencing errors.

Third generation sequencing: Oxford Nanopre, PacBio
No amplification needed, long reads and fast but high error rates at this point and concentrated samples are needed.

Functional screens: biochemical
not high-throuput but can directly asses metabollic potetnial of a comunity by testinf the ability to utilize specific substrates.

Fluoresence In Situ Hybridization:
can look for specific sequence existence in a community: have to look at highly conserved markers
Other methods:

#### What were the main questions being asked?  

Characterizing Photorhodopsin photosystems: structure, function and genetics
What are the minimal genetic elements required to compement the photorhodopsin system into E. coli. 


#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
DNA from environment (marine microplankton) -> F plasmid with increased duplication using an L-arabinose induced ORI -> transform into E. coli, look for orange growth on retinal containing and lacking media.-> isolate vectors: transposon mutagenesis -> transform into E. coli again: look for loss of phenotype: transposon sequening of loci with inserted sequence.
Light activated PR proton transfer measured using pH in media containing PR containing and PR deficient colonies. ATP synthesis was also measured using controls and using molecules to disrupt ATP synthase or to disrupt mitochondrial membrane impermeability to H+.

#### Summarize the main results or findings.  

-Engineering of hetrologous microbes!!!
-PR based photosystems can be expressed and function in E. coli without the addition of exogenous retinal. found an operon containing 6 genes involved in beta-carotene and retinal biosyntehsis which was adjacent to the photorhodopsin gene by sequencing. These genes are closely rranged and likely transfer together to other microbes. in E. coli the PR systems are capable of generating a proton gradient potentriating these cells to generate ATP using light (phototrophism). Also seen activation of phosphorylation of ADP by ATP synthase. High abundance of this system in marine environments indicate high levels of horizontal gene transfer.

Also cool: increasing F plasmid number of a single plasmid in bacteria: enhanegene expression: make it easier to screen for + and - phenotpyes.

#### Do new questions arise from the results?

- photorhodopsin and enhanced growth have not been definitively linked but so many microes have this system.

-What other functions might the photo-rhodopsin have in these marine bacteria othere than phototrophy: chemosensory, flagellar motility, nutrient acquisition functions


#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

long and tons of genetic jargon but overall easy to read.

The curve produced continues to increase sharply as more cells are classified.

* What can you conclude from the shape of your collector's curve as to your depth of sampling?

In Project 1, you will also see functions for calculating alpha-diversity in the `phyloseq` package since we will be working with data in that form.

For your sample:

* What are the Simpson Reciprocal Indices for your sample and community using the R function?
  community: 23.44748
  my Sample: 21.53069
* What are the chao1 estimates for your sample and community using the R function?
  community:52
  my sample:33
    + Verify that these values match your previous calculations: the Simpson Reciprocal Indices are exactly the same, and the chao1 estimates are relatively close.

#### Part 5: Concluding activity

* How does the measure of diversity depend on the definition of species in your samples?

The less stringent your classification scheme, the less species diversity will be seem. If different species definitions lead to the same number of species but different abundance:diversity ratios among the species: this will also affect the diversity calculations


* Can you think of alternative ways to cluster or bin your data that might change the observed number of species?

We could have disregarded colour in our classification scheme: this would drastially reduce the number of species observed and have an effect on diversity calculations

* How might different sequencing technologies influence observed diversity in a sample?
Sequencing methods that are error prone like the oxford nan-pore or sanger-sequencing: the observed diversity will likely be overestimated or you would get misclassification of some of our OTUs. Furthermore, more errors in sequencing platforms lead to more diversity in bp in the data collected resulting in an increased amount of diversity in the sample.


### Evidence Worksheet 05: Extensive mosaic structure

[Welch et al. 2002]( http://www.pnas.org/content/99/26/17020)

#### What were the main questions being asked?

-	How the genomes of different E. coli strains are composed.  
-	How the different genome compositions and structures can explain pathogenicity of different E. coli strains.    
-	How the genome structure can be used to understand to evolutionary history of E. coli.    
- ->Find differences between the three very similar strains.

#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

-	Genome sequence of uropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073 compared to enterohemorrhagic strain EDL933 and nonpathogenic lab strain MG1655.    
-	CFT073 was isolated from a woman with acute pyelonephritis and subsequently sequenced by generating whole-genome libraries.    
-	The genome sequence was analyzed using MAGPIE. Homologs in EDL933 and MG1655 of the potential CFT073 genes were searched using BLAST. Orthology was assumed when matches reached a threshold of 90% identity with at least 90% of the genes covered in an alignment.    

#### Summarize the main results or findings. 

-	The CFT073 genome of 5.2 Mb was successfully sequenced.    
-	Several features of the genome could be identified:  
    -	A restriction map was generated to confirm the circular structure of the genome.  
    - The Origin and terminus of the CFT073 genome corresponds to those of the MG1655 strain  
    - The genome contains no plasmids  
    - 5.533 coding genes were detected  
    - 247 CFT073-specific islands found with 2004 genes, 60 unique segments for virulence genes  
        - The specific islands account for 1.303 Mb, whereas MG1655 contains only 716 kb that are specific for this strain.  
-	Codon usage of islands was found to be different from the backbone genes, which is an indicator of lateral gene transfer.  
    - The backbone codon usage from CFT073 does not differ from the backbones of the other two strains. But the specific islands have different codon usage amongst the three strains.  
    - A Mosaic genome structure is generated where newly acquired genes are grouped together.  
    - CFT073 misses type III secretion system and plasmid encoded virulence genes, which explains differences in disease potential from EDL933.  
-	The CFT073 specific virulence genes contain fimbrial adhesins, autotransporters and phase switch recombinases.  
-	The chromosomal location and order of the pathogenicity genes differ from other uropathogenic strains.  
-	One CFT073 island contains part of a pathogenicity island from Yersinia pestis, suggesting the introduction of this island in the early evolution of extra intestinal E. coli.  
-	Many CFT073 islands are needed for the ability to colonyze the urinary tract:  
    - Fimbriae, pili for attachment to host cells.  
    - Phase switch recombinases that control the expression of fimbriae encoded on the fim operon.  
    - Autotransporters that export virulence factors  
    - Hemolysin genes that encode cytolytic toxins and their secretion system.  
-	Numbers of proteins shared between CFT073, DEL933 and MG1655: 2996 (39.2%)   
-	Numbers of proteins shared between CFT073 and DEL933: 204 (2.6%)  
-	Numbers of proteins shared between CFT073 and MG1655: 193 (2.5%)    
-	Numbers of proteins shared between DEL933 and MG1655: 514 (6.7%)    
-	Proteins specific for CFT073: 1623 (21.2%)   
-	Proteins specific for EDL933: 1346 (17.6%)    
-	Proteins specific for MG1655: 585 (7.6%)    

Conclusion:  

-	E. coli genomes show a mosaic structure with conserved backbones and strand specific islands.  
-	Uropathogenic stains show bigger genetic differences to other strains than previously assumed.  
-	Uropathogenic or intestinal pathogenic strains acquired specific pathogenicity islands witch made them able to colonyze the host's organs.  
-	Each strain contains different specific islands with strong variation in their linkage and chromosomal arrangement, which gives the strains their characteristic traits.  


#### Do new questions arise from the results?

-	The results suggest that extraintestinal strains might be as diverse as the intestinal strains. This remains to be verified.  
-	Whether specific gene subsets can be found that can be used to differentiate between uropathogenic strains.  
-	Whether new genetic regions can be found that are subject to variation due to recombinase activities.  
-	Whether "black holes" can be found in CFT073: Deletions of genes that would lead to disadvantages in the specific lifestyle of uropathogens.  
-	The presence of huge amounts of specific islands raises the question, whether species definitions based on only a few phenotypic traits and low-resolution mapping should be reconsidered  

#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 


In general, the paper was simple to follow, with reasonable assumptions and conclusions.
However, the methods how they analyzed and compared the genomes were not explained very detailed. More detailed description of their methods would have been helpful for better understanding of the obtained results.

#### Based on your reading and discussion notes, explain the meaning and content of the following figure derived from the comparative genomic analysis of three E. coli genomes by Welch et al. Remember that CFT073 is a uropathogenic strain and that EDL933 is an enterohemorrhagic strain. Explain how this study relates to your understanding of ecotype diversity. Provide a definition of ecotype in the context of the human body. Explain why certain subsets of genes in CFT073 provide adaptive traits under your ecological model and speculate on their mode of vertical descent or gene transfer.

![](c:/Users/Jawairia/Documents/MICB425_portfolio/Evidence_worksheet5_image.jpg)


An Ecotype is a bacterial species that occupies a specific ecological niche. Different ecotypes can live in the same habitat but do not compete for the same nutrients/ environmental factors and therefore obtain different niches, which allows them to evolve independently from each other. In the human body for example, several different bacteria can live in the gut but rely on different carbon sources/ factors and therefore are different ecotypes. They can also have differences in their exact localization within the gut, eg in the microvilli/ gut lumen/ cryptae.. Different ecotypes can have very identical 16s RNA sequences but differ significantly in genetic islands specific for the niche they occupy.

The figure shows that the different strains have different genetic islands in their genomes. The differences in the islands can be explained by the different niches/ habitats within the human that these two strains occupy. The colonization of the urinary tract requires some different genes than the colonization of the gut. Different genes are needed to colonize the urethra and to metabolize the present nutrients than to colonize and live in the gut. 
The figure also shows that the specific islands are localized on a shared backbone of the different strains.  


The genes that are specific for a distinct niche are mainly inherited vertically to conserve the separation of the different ecotypes. The vertical inheritance of the specific genes (gene islands) conserves the ability of the strains to colonize their specific habitats. If horizontal gene transfer occurs between cells from different ecotypes, a switch in the ecotype of the recipient cell occur, leading to the occupation of a new niche for this ecotype.

### Module 3 essay

Discuss the challenges involved in defining a microbial species and how HGT complicates matters, especially in the context of the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of microbial metabolic pathways. Can you comment on how HGT influences the maintenance of global biogeochemical cycles through time? Finally, do you think it is necessary to have a clear definition of a microbial species? Why or why not?



How to decide for a clear definition of microbial species is an often-discussed issue. The biological species concept cannot be applied for microbes as they do not reproduce sexually. Many alternative concepts exist that use different approaches to define species. Each of these definitions has their own advantages and disadvantages, which makes it difficult to agree on one that fits the needs of all purposes. Some of the most important concepts will be discussed in more detail in this assay. At first, probably the most often applied concept is to assign two individuals to the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU) if their 16s rDNA shows more than 97% identity. A more recently developed method is to define species by amplicon sequence variants (ASV). This method has the potential of even higher resolution than the OTU definition as it defines an exact nucleotide sequence for each species. Another factor that makes species definitions even more challenging is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This microbial version of "sexual" recombination leads to difficulties in many phylogenetic approaches. Through HGT, even distantly related species can harbor very similar DNA fragments. This allows for a global distribution and maintenance of key metabolic pathways but in turn also leads to a high potential for wrong species-assignments. One method to overcome the problems of HGT is multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA). MLSA tries to eliminate genes acquired from horizontal transfer by comparing several conserved genes instead of just one, as the OTU and ASV methods do. Regarding all these challenges in species definition, the question arises whether it is even necessary to have a clear definition? In order to find an answer to this question, it is necessary to first obtain a deeper understanding of the present species definitions.  


Defining microbial species by a 16s RNA identity of 97% or more has become the standard approach over the last years. This method has been shown to achieve well dissolved phylogenetic assignments in numerous cases. However, with increasing amounts of available data, several problems of this method could be identified. Firstly, as only the 16s rDNA is considered, a lot of variation might be missed. Two species can have completely different sequences in the main parts of their genomes, with just very similar 16s rDNA and thus get clustered together as the same species. Second, one species can have multiple copies of the 16s RNA gene. This means that we have to decide which of the copies we want to use for the species definition. In addition, if the sequence data comes from an unknown environmental sample, one might not even realize that the two 16s rDNA sequences come from the same genome and therefore assign them to two different species. Third, as more genomic data of very closely related species became available, the resolution of 16s rDNA turned out not to be sufficient anymore to separate these species. In these cases, the 16s rDNA shows too high levels of conservation to be sufficient for separation of very similar species. Another challenge that arises from this problem is the decision of how to differentiate between species and strains. This problem again could be the subject of a whole essay.  
	
	
The more recent amplicon sequence variants (ASV) method has been shown to overcome some of the problems of the 97% rDNA identity OTU definition approach. This method does not rely on an arbitrarily chosen identity threshold, but instead defines species by one exact nucleotide sequence[1]. Therefore, this method provides higher resolution as it distinguishes sequences that even differ by just one nucleotide. However, this method too struggles with some challenges in species definition. In the process of defining one exact sequence to be the true one, many sequences which are assumed to contain sequencing errors have to be discarded. This means, that sequences which are more error-prone get discarded more often and might not be detected as species. In addition, this denoising step is very laborious and therefore requires a lot of capacity if big data sets have to be processed. Another problem is that if a wrong sequence is chosen as a species-defining ASV, the mistake immediately leads to an incorrectly defined species. One challenge the ASV method shares with the OTU method is, that it tries to define species by only one DNA locus. Thus, with ASV again, there is no guarantee that two species actually are the same or even closely related just because they have the same sequence in the observed amplicon.   
	
	
The past two paragraphs show that the process of defining species can be very challenging. One factor that makes these definitions even more difficult is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Many bacterial species can exchange some of their genes through HGT even if they are very distantly related. Therefore, individual genes within a single genome can have different evolutionary histories. This leads to varying phylogenetic trees and species assignments, depending on which genes are analyzed. For example, two species can have high similarity in 16s rDNA and other housekeeping genes, but still differ in great parts of their genomes, like specific pathogenicity islands[2]. Else, due to HGT, two species can be identical in most parts of their genomes, with differences in only a few very specific loci [3]. In both cases, 16s rDNA alone would not be sufficient to separate the ecotypes that share the same ribosomal DNA but have clear phenotypic or ecological differences in terms of the niches they occupy. A method to deal with the problem of HGT interfering with the definition of these ecotypes, is multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA). In MLSA, several conserved housekeeping genes are concatenated and analyzed [4]. This method has two major positive properties. First, the interfering effects of HGT get eliminated, with increasing success, the more different genes are analyzed. Second, using multiple genes for sequence comparison, strongly increases the obtained resolution to distinguish species or ecotypes. Thus, the MLSA method is well worth considering as alternative to the single gene based methods which are more prone to get biased by HGT.   
	
	
Because of horizontal gene transfer and following selective pressure, the genes for many key metabolic pathways get distributed all over the world in many different species. On one hand, this makes it difficult to generate phylogenetic trees and distinguish species, as discussed in the previous paragraph. But on the other hand, HGT assures the maintenance of global biogeochemical cycles, allowing the microbes to function as guardians of the metabolism [5]. Different environments with strong selective pressures favor the survival of only the best adapted microbes. Bacteria that fail to adapt fast enough to a changing environment go extinct. However, because of HGT, their specialized metabolic pathways often survive in another species in a different environment somewhere else on the planet. Thus, HGT ensures the maintenance of global biogeochemical cycles through time as it enables the distribution of key metabolic genes across species all over the world.  
  
  
The massive amount of HGT plays an important role in the distribution of metabolic pathways and evolution of microbes. This extensive genomic fluidity strongly increases the challenges in defining microbial species and has led to some scientists questioning the existence of any microbial species [6]. But is it even necessary to have a clear definition of microbial species? Intuitively, one might think that a single, universal definition of microbial species would be very useful. Assigning an individual to a species would be much simpler if just one clear rule with a universal cutoff existed. Also, if two species are compared, one would immediately know the minimal level of genetic difference between the two species. However, despite these obvious and strong advantages of a clear definition, I think that it is important to allow for varying species definitions. An example from Fraser et al [7] illustrates this on three closely related bacterial species: Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen, S. mitis, a commensal and S. pseudopneumoniae, a species of uncertain status. Of these three species, S. mitis contains the highest genetic diversity of about 5%. This distance is about the same as the average distance between two genomes of S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae. Therefore, applying a universal cutoff means that either S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae had to be clustered together, or S. mitis would be split into many distinct species. This example clearly shows that one clear species definition with a defined cutoff is not only unnecessary, but even detrimental in many cases. Often, several context dependent aspects have to be considered in order to achieve satisfying clustering of microbes. For the generation of phylogenetic trees, varying phenotypical and ecological properties are arguably as important as genetic similarity. By considering only the 16s rDNA identity, many ecotypes would be missed in the analysis. Thus, it is often important to look at many different metabolic genes to be able to identify differences in ecotypes occupying different niches, despite their great genetic similarity.  
  
  
In conclusion, the definition of microbial species encounters many challenges. Several approaches exist that try to sort species by a clearly defined threshold of genetic similarity in some single or multiple genes. Each of these methods has their own advantages and disadvantages and none can be clearly considered as the best one. A factor making species definitions even more complicated is HGT. Extensive gene exchanges distribute key genes all across the bacterial domain, leading to the maintenance of biogeochemical cycles by a globally shared core genome. This genome fluidity allows for fast bacterial evolution and adaptation, but in turn causes serious problems in the attempt of defining species. However, a clear species definition is not always necessary after all. Satisfying clustering of microbes often needs context dependent, varying definitions, considering also ecological aspects and many metabolic genes, not just similarity in the 16s rDNA. As a new approach, it might even be worth considering to completely give up on any universal species concepts. Instead, many different methods could be applied simultaneously, leading to several different, even overlapping clusters of taxa. Therefore, for each application, the best clustering method could be chosen to address the particular problem or question in an optimal way.
